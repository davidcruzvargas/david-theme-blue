# david-theme-yellow
I made this theme just to myself, trying to experiment a little with a high contrast theme. If someone wants
to use it, is more than welcome. Feedback is well-received.

Regarding the colorScheme I'm using most of the code of [HiberbeeDark](https://github.com/hiberbee/jetbrains-ide-theme) 
with some changes to adapt to new colors I'm selecting for this theme.
